> **Abstract:** In vitro investigations, which comprise the bulk of
> research efforts geared at identifying an underlying biomechanical
> mechanism for extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), are commonly
> hampered by inadequate descriptions of the underlying therapeutic
> acoustical pressure waves. We demonstrate the necessity of in-situ
> sound pressure measurements inside the treated samples considering the
> signiﬁcant differences associated with available applicator
> technologies and cell containment. A statistical analysis of
> pulse-to-pulse variability in an electrohydraulic applicator yields a
> recommendation for a minimal pulse number of n = 300 for cell pallets
> and suspensions to achieve reproducible treatments. Non-linear
> absorption behavior of sample holders and boundary effects are shown
> for transient peak pressures and applied energies and may serve as a
> guide when

> For the use in microbiological investigations of ESWT we provide
> actionable identiﬁcation of common problems in describing physical
> shockwave parameters and improving experimental setups by; (1)
> promoting in-situ sound ﬁeld measurements, (2) statistical evaluation
> of applicator variability, and (3) extrapolation of treatment
