been increasingly applied to a broad range of musculoskeletal
conditions.7,19 These applica-tions include calciﬁc tendinitis of the
shoulder, nonunion, and delayed union of fractures.19,20 These
applications initially stemmed from the concept of disintegrating
calciﬁcations in the shoulder that were similar to lithotriptic renal
stone disintegration.25 The fracture application was chosen based on
observations obtained during animal lithotripsy studies of the bio-logic
tissue effects of shock waves, namely that shock waves striking the
pelvis elicited a signiﬁcant osteogenic response.9,11,12 Because this
technology is relatively new to orthopae-dics, the authors think that
potential users should have an overview of the physical prin-ciples
involved when shock waves are directed toward musculoskeletal tissues.

**Basic** **Physics**

The steepening of a sound wave is caused by the pressure dependency of
the wave propaga-tion. The velocity of the sound wave increases with
increasing pressure. Therefore, wavelets at high pressure move faster
than the wavelets at lower pressure, which leads to adeformation of the
wave. For very high sound intensities, the wave crest assumes a sawtooth
appearance. With increasing amplitude, it subsequently be-comes a shock
wave.

A clinically applicable shock wave repre-sents nothing more than a
controlled explosion producing a sonic pulse in much the same way as a
fast ﬂying aircraft may produce a sonic

> boundary layer between two media one part of an approaching shock wave

and the other part will be transmitted. Losses through attenuation
depend on the medium through which they are transmitted. In air, the
attenuation is very high. The sound of a bang-ing hammer is not going to
hurt; traveling through air the sound wave generated by im-pact with a
nail will have lost most of its en-ergy by the time it reaches the body.
In water, however, losses through attenuation are ap-proximately 1000
times lower than an air.

A shock wave is a sonic pulse that has cer-tain physical
characteristics. There is a high peak pressure, sometimes more than 100
MPa (500 bar), but more often approximately 50 to 80 MPa, a fast initial
rise in pressure during a period of less than 10 ns, a low tensile
ampli-tude (up to 10 MPa), a short life cycle of ap-proximately 10 ms,
and a broad frequency spectrum, typically in the range of 16 Hz to 20
MHz.19 The measured shock wave rise time is in the 30 ns range when
determined by limited time resolution of the pressure recording
hy-drophone. The positive pressure amplitude is followed by a
diffraction-induced tensile wave of a few microseconds duration. Figure
1 shows the form of a typical shock wave and highlights the various
physical parameters as-sociated with such sonic pulses.

For shock waves to be effective in the clin-ical situation, the
maximally beneﬁcial pulse energy must be focused (concentrated) at the
point at which treatment is to be provided. There are two basic effects:

**Methods** **of** **Shock** **Wave** **Generation**

There are three main techniques through which shock waves may be
generated (Fig 2). These are the electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, and
piezoelectric principles, each of which repre-sents a different
technique of generating the shock wave. All of these techniques of shock
wave production depend on the conversion of electrical energy to
mechanical energy.

The basic concept of each device is similar, and is based on the
principle that the acoustic impedances within the human body are very
similar to those of water. Accordingly, the shock waves are generated
within water and subsequently transferred to the human body by means of
an appropriate contact medium. This ensures small losses attributable to
atten-uation and reﬂection by any boundary areas. The energy of the
shock wave will be concen-trated in the treatment focus (F2).

**Electrohydraulic** **Principle**

Shock wave generation through the electrohy-draulic principle represents
the ﬁrst generation of orthopaedic shock wave machines (Fig 2A). The
device acts in a similar way to the spark plug of acar. A high voltage

>
> **Electromagnetic** **Principle**
>
> The second device uses an electromagnetic coil and an opposing metal
> membrane (Fig 2B). This technique of producing shock waves ﬁrst was
> described by Eisenmenger.8 An elec-tric current is passed through a
> coil to produce a strong magnetic ﬁeld. A high current pulse is
> released through the coil, generating a strong, variable magnetic
> ﬁeld, which, in turn, in-duces a high current in the opposed metal
> membrane. This strong magnetic ﬁeld then causes an adjacent, highly
> conductive mem-brane to be forced rapidly away, thus com-pressing the
> surrounding ﬂuid medium to pro-duce a shock wave. A lens is used to
> focus the

wave, with the focal therapeutic point being deﬁned by the focal length
of the lens. The am-plitude of the focused wave increases by
non-linearities when the acoustical wave propa-gates toward the focal
point.

**Piezoelectric** **Principle**

A large number (usually .1000) of piezocrys-tals is mounted on the
inside of asphere and re-ceives a rapid electrical discharge (Fig 2C).
This causes deformation (contraction and ex-pansion) of the crystals
(piezoelectric effect), which induces a pressure pulse in the
sur-rounding water steepening to a shock wave. The geometric arrangement
of the crystals along the inside of the sphere causes self-focusing of
the wave toward the center. This leads to an extremely precise focusing
and a high energy density within a well-conﬁned fo-cal volume.

**Deﬁnition** **of** **Physical** **Parameters**

When studying the effects of shock waves on soft tissues or bone the
focal volume of the tar-get tissue exposed to the shock waves be-comes
critical. In theory, the waves are fo-cused on one focal point (F ), but
in fact they have effects over a far more substantial focal volume (Fig
4). In urology, the focal volume may be matched to the size of the renal
stone. If there is too small a focal volume, the stone is not
disintegrated fully and complications may ensue. A larger focal volume,
which can be attained by manipulating a heel or elbow while the shocks
are applied, ensures a greater area of involved tissue will be affected.

>
> The pressure (measured in MegaPascals) gener-ated by a shock wave as a
> function of time and space, is the parameter that is most amenable to

direct measurement. However, such measure-ments are challenging
technically. They com-monly were done with needle hydrophones on a
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride basis. The hydrophones use the piezoelectric
effect, encounter problems measuring the tensile parts of the wave, and
have a very limited life expectancy. Recently, a ﬁberoptic hydrophone
has become available that also can measure the tensile forces. It has
become the method of choice in shock wave measurements.

The pressure ﬁeld is maximal at the focal center but in addition,
signiﬁcant effects may be produced over neighboring regions of tis-sue
and the dimensions of such zones will vary according to the precise
shock wave treatment provided. The zone around the focal region may be
deﬁned in three different axes to cre-ate the focal volume (Fig 4).

*Energy* *Flux* *Density*

The energy ﬂux density is a measure of the en-ergy per square area that
is being released by the sonic pulse at a speciﬁc (ﬁnite) point. En-ergy
ﬂux density may be derived from pres-sure and can be computed as the
area below the squared pressure time curve. Energy ﬂux density must not
be confused with energy. It is important when considering threshold
values in generating certain biologic effects.

*Energy*

The energy ﬂux (as much as 1.5 mJ/mm2) and the peak pulse energy (as
many as 100 MPa) are determined by the temporal and spatial
dis-tribution of the pressure proﬁle. The energy ﬂux density describes
the maximum amount of acoustical energy that is transmitted through an
area of 1 mm2 per pulse. The total pulse energy is the sum of all energy
densities across the beam proﬁle. It describes the total acoustical
energy per released shock wave.

Although energy ﬂux density relates to the energy released at a certain
point, the energy of a shock wave is the total amount of energy released
within adeﬁned region. The energy is the energy ﬂux density as
integrated over the entire region.

bles 1, 2). The individual values of the various devices on the market
(especially in Europe) or being tested (in the United States) now are
published by the German and International Society for Extracorporeal
Shock Wave Ther-apy.10 Correlations between pressure, energy ﬂux
density, and the energy during shock wave treatment now can be analyzed
accu-rately. It is hoped that the treatment of muscu-loskeletal
conditions may be put on a more factual and rational basis.

Quantiﬁcation of the sound ﬁeld and mea-surements of its parameters will
enable med-ical researchers to use the technical data to correlate them
with biologic events. The inﬂu-ence of pressure, energy ﬂux density, and
en-ergy of the shock wave on the medical appli-cations can be analyzed.
Hopefully, this will lead to better understanding of biologic processes
such as bone healing induced by this method. Additional advances of the
scientiﬁc understanding will determine whether there are speciﬁc
orthopaedic requirements calling for technical reﬁnements of the

tive to stone disintegration, the shock waves presumably cause high
stress forces on the stone surface by the high pressure amplitude and
the short rise time, thus exceeding the elas-tic strength of the stone
and disintegrating its surface.1,2,13

Shock waves generate high stresses that act on boundary interfaces and,
in addition, gen-erate tensile forces that cause cavitation. In vitro
studies by those concerned with urologic problems have deﬁned the forces
required to disintegrate artiﬁcial stones.13 The volume of stone
material that will be disintegrated (V) is related to the number of
shock wave pulses ap-plied (n) and the total energy of each pulse (E) by

The reﬂected portion of the sound wave is growing with an increase of
the differences of their impedance according to I 5 I (Z 2 Z ) / (Z 1 Z
) with I being the amplitude (inten-sity) of the reﬂected and I the
amplitude (in-tensity) of the initial sound wave. The higher the
acoustic impedance mismatch, the higher the portion of reﬂected energy.
If the impedance of medium 1 (Z ) is larger than that of medium 2 (Z ),
this leads to a negative intensity of the re-ﬂected wave, which causes
tensile forces.

When the shock wave is propagating through one medium and hits an
interface of a second, different medium, part of the wave is
transmit-ted and part of the wave is reﬂected. The ratio of the

The microdisruption process and the side effects are a function of the
total amount of en-ergy absorbed in a ﬁnite volume, independent of
cavitation or direct shock wave effects. The shock waves seem to cause
trabecular micro-fractures or interstitial gaps, probably causedby
cavitation.

The resorption of calciﬁc deposits (in the shoulder) may be correlated
with the total amount of applied acoustic energy.16,17 Pain relief also
seems to be a function of the total applied energy.

A certain threshold value of energy density has to be exceeded to
stimulate any healing process, and to lead to any signiﬁcant side
ef-fects. Such a threshold dosage of energy is not different from
concepts such as cidal and sta-tic effects of an antibiotic. Although
the en-ergy density (mJ/mm2) of a shock wave is im-portant, the more
clinically relevant physical parameter may be the total amount of
acoustic energy administered in one shock wave pulse. The current
overview is intended to give an introduction to the basic physics of
extracor-poreal shock wave therapy. The objective is to clarify the role
of deﬁned parameters necessary in quantitative research. Extracorporeal
shock wave therapy has its roots in extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy, a method ﬁrmly estab-lished in urology as a nonsurgical
method to disintegrate concrements in the renal and uri-nary tracts. The
method is noninvasive, very effective, and has few side effects.
Currently, approximately 98% of renal concrements are being treated by
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.20 However, the biologic effects
of this method are not restricted to the fragmenta-tion of concrements.
Stimulation of bone for-mation in cases of retarded healing of bone
fractures and nonunions and the promotion of healing of tendinopathies
have been shown.8,27 Although the biologic mechanisms are not known in
detail, the positive results of the treat-ments have been shown in an
increasing num-

ber of studies.7,16,18–20,22
